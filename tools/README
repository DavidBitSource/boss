Directory structure:

blf2xml:	converts label files in blf format into xml files.
addcontext:	a tool for adding the phone and syllable contexts to the XML structure of the label file.
		All context and context class attributes are added here (e.g., CLeft and CRight).
addphrases:	adds phrasing information to phone and syllable levels. The attributes PInt and PMode are
		added to all <SYLLABLE> and <PHONEME> tags.
alignflag:	adds an Align attribute to <PHONEME> and <SYLLABLE> tags, describing whether label files have
		been aligned manually or automatically. This attribute can also be exploited for pruning,
		if the Align attribute is used as a prerequisite in the pre-selection phase of the unit selection
		algorithm.
optbounds:	shifts all segment boundaries to the nearest zero crossing.
melbounds:	calculates the mel cepstrum coefficients needed for unit selection. 22 attributes are added to each
		<WORD>, <SYLLABLE> and <PHONEME> element, 11 for the left boundary of the unit, and 11 for the
		right boundary	(LM0 ... LM10 and RM0 ... RM10).
blfxml2db:	imports fully annotated xml label files into the MySQL database.
traing2p:       used for the training of syllable, stress and transcription trees for grapheme-to-phone conversion (in boss_g2p).
addf0:          adds F0 and RMS values to the XML structure (attributes: AVGFO, LF0, RF0, RMS).
